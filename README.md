# Alarm-clock
With this project in Python, we have successfully made the Alarm Clock. We used the popular GUI library for rendering graphics on a display window. We learned how to extract the current time from the computer and to use it for manipulation using the DateTime library This way we can set an alarm in the computer interface using python programming.
